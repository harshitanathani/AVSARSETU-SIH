# Contributing to AvsarSetu

Thanks for wanting to contribute! This document explains how to set up the project locally, the workflow we use, and some small guidelines to keep contributions consistent.

Getting started

```bash
git clone git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/avsarsetu.git
cd avsarsetu
```

2. Install dependencies

npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file from `.env.example` and fill required values.

4. Start backend and frontend (two terminals)

```bash
node server.mjs
npm run dev
```

Branching

- Keep commits small and focused. Use conventional commit messages when possible.

Pull requests

- Open a PR against the `main` branch.
- Add a clear description of the change and any testing done.
- CI will run tests and linting (if configured).

Code style

- Use TypeScript for frontend files.
- Keep components small and reusable.

Reporting issues
